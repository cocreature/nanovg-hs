# NanoVG Haskell bindings

[![Build Status](https://img.shields.io/travis/cocreature/nanovg-hs.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/cocreature/nanovg-hs)

Currently only the GL3 backend is supported.

A large part of the example bundled with
[NanoVG](https://github.com/memononen/nanovg) is translated into
Haskell and bundled as `example00`.

Most of the bindings directly expose the corresponding
[NanoVG](https://github.com/memononen/nanovg) so look there for more
details on the usage.

There is also a [diagrams backend](https://github.com/cocreature/diagrams-nanovg) using these bindings.

Feel free to open issues if you have any ideas for improvements (or even better PRs :)).
